@interface ZegoExpressEngine (Player)

/// Start playting stream
/// @discussion This interface allows users to play audio and video streams from the ZEGO real-time audio and video cloud.Before starting to play the stream, you need to join the room first, you can get the new streamID in the room by listening to the onRoomStreamUpdate event callback.In the case of poor network quality, user play may be interrupted, the SDK will try to reconnect, and the current play status and error information can be obtained by listening to the onPlayerStateUpdate event.Playing the stream ID that does not exist, the SDK continues to try to play after executing this interface. After the stream ID is successfully pushed, the audio and video stream can be actually played.The developer can update the player canvas by calling this interface again(the streamID must be the same).
